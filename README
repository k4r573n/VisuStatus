This Project is to visualize important information.
VisuStatus collects information of the computer's 
status - sends them with Send2Parport to an LED-device 
connected to the parallel port.


LED Device
'''''''''''
each Bit of the parport is connected with a transistor
to a LED (try google to find a chematic plan)


Send2Parport
'''''''''''''
this is an c-program to send the bits to the led-device


visustatus.sh
'''''''''''''
this script collects information and sends them with 
Send2Parport to the parallel port


checklogin.sh checkping.sh
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
needed by visustatus
